# Salary Projection Linear Regression Model

## Project Description

The Salary Projection Linear Regression Model is a machine learning project aimed at predicting employee salaries within a company based on various influencing factors. Utilizing a linear regression model trained on a rich and diverse dataset, this project seeks to provide accurate salary predictions. These predictions are based on age, gender, education level, job title, and years of experience, offering valuable insights into the determinants of salary structures and aiding in informed salary decision-making processes.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset underpinning this project contains detailed information on company employees, with each row representing an individual employee. The dataset is designed to capture significant attributes believed to influence salary structures, including:

- **Age**: Numeric, representing the employee's age.
- **Gender**: Categorical, indicating the employee's gender (Male/Female).
- **Education Level**: Categorical, detailing the highest level of education attained (High School/Bachelor's Degree/Master's Degree/PhD).
- **Job Title**: Categorical, specifying the employee's position within the company.
- **Years of Experience**: Numeric, denoting the total years of professional experience the employee has.
- **Salary**: Numeric, representing the employee's annual salary in US dollars.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salary-projection-linear-regression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd salary-projection-linear-regression
   ```
3. Install required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

## How to Use

To use this model to predict salaries, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your data file in CSV format. Ensure it follows the structure of the dataset overview, with appropriate columns for Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, Years of Experience, and Salary (for training).

2. Run the prediction script with your data file as input. Replace `your_data.csv` with the path to your CSV file:
   ```
   python predict_salary.py your_data.csv
   ```

3. The script will output the predicted salaries based on the input data. For detailed usage and more options, please refer to the documentation within the script.
